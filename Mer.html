        <p id="p">Mercedes-Benz is commonly referred to as Mercedes and sometimes as Benz, is a German luxury and commercial vehicle automotive brand established in 1926. Mercedes-Benz AG (a Mercedes-Benz Group subsidiary established in 2019) is headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.[1] Mercedes-Benz AG produces consumer luxury vehicles and commercial vehicles badged as Mercedes-Benz. From November 2019 onwards, Mercedes-Benz-badged heavy commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) are managed by Daimler Truck, a former part of the Mercedes-Benz Group turned into an independent company in late 2021. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz was the largest brand of premium vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31 million passenger cars.[8]

            The brand's origins lie in Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and Carl Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled automobile. The slogan for the brand is "the best or nothing"<br>  
            Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's creation of the first internal combustion engine in a car, seen in the Benz Patent Motorwagen – financed by Bertha Benz's dowry[10] and patented in January 1886[11] – and Gottlieb Daimler and their engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach, with the addition of a petrol engine, introduced later that year. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG).

Emil Jellinek, a European automobile entrepreneur who worked with DMG, registered the trademark in 1902, naming the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp after his daughter Mercedes Jellinek. Jellinek was a businessman and marketing strategist who promoted "horseless" Daimler automobiles among the highest circles of society in his adopted home. At the time, it was a meeting place for the haute volée of France and Europe, especially in winter. His customers included the Rothschild family and other well-known people, but Jellinek's plans went further, and as early as 1901, he was selling Mercedes cars in the "New World", as well, including United States billionaires Rockefeller, Astor, Morgan, and Taylor. At the Nice race he attended in 1899, Jellinek drove under the pseudonym "Monsieur Mercédès" as a way of concealing his less fancy real name. Many consider that race the birth of Mercedes-Benz as a brand. In 1901, the name "Mercedes" was re-registered by DMG worldwide as a protected trademark.[12] The first Mercedes-Benz branded vehicles were produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler's companies into the Daimler-Benz company on 28 June of the same year.[11][13]


Gottlieb Daimler (1834-1900) - founder of Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft
Gottlieb Daimler was born on 17 March 1834 in Schorndorf. After training as a gunsmith and working in France, he attended the Polytechnic School in Stuttgart from 1857 to 1859. After completing various technical activities in France and England, he started working as a draftsman in Geislingen in 1862. At the end of 1863, he was appointed workshop inspector at a machine-tool factory in Reutlingen, where he met Wilhelm Maybach in 1865.[14]

Throughout the 1930s, Mercedes-Benz produced the 770 model, a car that was notably popular throughout Germany's Nazi period. Adolf Hitler was known to have driven in a model of this car during his time in power, with modified custom bulletproof windshields.[15] Most of the currently surviving 770 models were sold at auctions to private buyers. One of the cars is currently on display at the War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario. The pontiff's Popemobile has often been sourced from Mercedes-Benz.[16]

From 1937 onward, Daimler Benz focused increasingly on military products such as the LG3000 lorry and the DB600 and the DB601 aero engines. To build the latter, in 1936, it built a factory hidden in the forest at Genshagen around 10 km south of Berlin. By 1942, the company had mostly stopped producing cars, and was now devoted to war production. According to its statement, in 1944, almost half of its 63,610 employees were forced labourers, prisoners of war, or concentration-camp detainees.[17] Another source quotes this figure at 46,000. The company later paid $12 million in reparations to the labourers' families.[18]

In 1958, the two companies began a partnership to sell their cars in the United States with Studebaker. A few American-based Daimler Benz dealerships were converted into Mercedes-Benz dealerships when Daimler's non-Mercedes-partnered company closed in 1966.

Over the decades, Mercedes-Benz has introduced many electronic and mechanical innovations and safety features that later became common.[19] Currently, Mercedes-Benz is one of the best-known and longest-standing automotive brands in the world.

In November 2019, Daimler AG announced that Mercedes-Benz, until that point a company marque, would be spun off into a separate, wholly owned subsidiary called Mercedes-Benz AG. The new subsidiary would manage the Mercedes-Benz car and van business. Mercedes-Benz-badged trucks and buses would be part of the Daimler Truck AG subsidiary.[1]

For information relating to the three-pointed star symbol of the brand, see under the title Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft, including the merger into Daimler-Benz.

In May 2022, Mercedes-Benz announced that it has recently sold the most expensive car at the price of $142 million. The car is a very rare 1955 Mercedes-Benz SLR that has been kept in the German automaker's collection and bought by a private owner. Mercedes in an announcement said that the sale will be used to establish the Mercedes-Benz Fund.[20]

In June 2022, Mercedes-Benz recalled almost one million vehicles built between 2004 and 2015, due to potential problems with their braking system, caused by possible "advanced corrosion".[21]

        <h5><b>2016 Mercedes-Maybach s600</b></h5>
        <h2><b>PRICE- $246,300</b></h2>
        <p>If an alternate universe exists in which a $246,300 sedan counts as a bargain, the 2016 Mercedes-Maybach S600 sits at its center. You wouldn't know it sitting in the hyper-luxurious Maybach's huge back seat, or even if you're lucky enough to chauffeur others from behind its wood-rimmed two-spoke steering wheel. Sure, at times the S600 can feel like an extra-nice Mercedes-Benz S-class, but given how the S-class isn’t exactly clapped-out, these associations are passing at worst. No, the Mercedes-Maybach feels special, feels solid, and most important, it feels expensive—and who are we kidding? Any car over $200K is certifiably deluxe. Now, come with us as we take you on a visual tour of just what makes the Maybach so nice: <br>
            In the U.S., the new car will launch as the Mercedes-Maybach S600, fitted with the same 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged V-12 that powers the “regular” Mercedes-Benz S600. It makes 523 horsepower and 612 lb-ft of torque, and it viciously runs the car into an electronic governor at 155 mph. Acceleration to 62 mph is said to take five seconds flat. Other markets will be offered the Mercedes-Maybach in eight-cylinder S550 and six-cylinder S400 forms.

            The most obvious thing the Maybach delivers is space—and plenty of it. The length and wheelbase have increased by 7.9 inches, all of which benefit the rear passengers. The aft compartment has much more legroom and a bit more headroom, and it offers what Daimler claims is the quietest back-seat experience in any production car. A full panoramic sunroof is standard, as are privacy shades for the rear glass, and while the S-class already features a best-in-class interior, the Mercedes-Maybach adds further details.
            
            These include expansive and unique wraparound wood trim, Maybach logos on the C-pillar and embossed into the center armrests, an IWC-badged clock with individually milled numbers, chrome-plated speaker grilles, and fiber-optic ambient lighting. There’s also Burmester 3-D surround sound, tweeters in the rear doors that “spiral” toward passengers, and a pair of Robbe & Berking silver-plated champagne flutes. The rear seats both offer a full range of power adjustability—including a backrest that can be moved independently of the seat bottom—a massaging function, and powered calf supports. A footrest can be motored out of the front passenger seatback for sleeping or relaxing. Cooling and warming cup holders are available, as are articulated tables that unfold from the rear center console. The rear air “nozzles” are done in a wood finish. Put simply, the car is sumptuous without being garish.

        <h5><b>2022 G-Class Sedan Suv</b></h5>
        <h2><b>PRICE- $139,900</b></h2>
        <p>When it comes to off-road capability and luxury pedigree, the 2022 Mercedes-Benz G-class is in a class of its own. Also known as the Geländewagen, it's essentially a Ford Bronco or Jeep Wrangler for the rich and famous. However, just because Mercedes' retro-styled, richly appointed SUV has a six-figure price tag and upscale features such as massaging front seats doesn't mean it can't tackle seriously treacherous terrain—though we’re confident that few of its wealthy owners will ever test its lofty limits off-road. Despite bodywork that might be mistaken for its predecessor, which debuted back in 1979 and was based on a military vehicle, the 2022 G-wagen has a much more refined ride and a plethora of modern technology. It’ll just as easily comfort a quartet of adults on their way to a Broadway show as it’ll conquer a rutted, muddy trail with ease. <br>
            Every G-class commands a six-figure price, and the number can get a lot higher with the wide array of expensive options. We’d avoid the priciest upgrades and enhance our version with thoughtful choices. These include the Exclusive Interior package that adds the nicer nappa leather upholstery and snazzier trim pieces. The Seat Comfort package includes massaging front seats with ventilated cushions, and the available adaptive dampers allow adjustable ride quality. The only other option we’d choose is the heated steering wheel.

            <b style="color: lightblue;">Engine, Transmission, and Performance:</b>
            Powered by a twin-turbo V-8 that makes 416 horsepower and 450 pound-feet of torque, the G550 is as quick on the street as it is capable on the trail. All-wheel drive is standard on the G550, and its engine shuttles power through an obedient nine-speed automatic transmission. The 2019 G550 that we tested had much-improved road manners compared with the outgoing model, thanks to an independent front suspension and a lower center of gravity. However, its square and tall body caused a lot of wind noise at higher speeds, and it sure doesn’t help the SUV feel swift around corners. Still, the G550’s steering feels more precise than ever and the ride quality is composed on all but the choppiest surfaces. Mercedes also equips each G-class with three locking differentials and a low-range gear, which means it can tackle just about any terrain. That along with generous ground clearance and a maximum towing capacity of 7000 pounds make it a useful tool when it’s not shuttling socialites.
           <b  style="color: lightblue;">Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG:</b>
           Those who can afford to own a G550 should have deep enough pockets to cover its propensity to swill gasoline. The EPA expects every model to earn 13 mpg in the city and 17 mpg on the highway. We tested one on our 75-mph highway fuel-economy route—part of our extensive testing regimen—and found that it failed to meet government expectations, earning 15 mpg in the real world. For more information about the G-class’s fuel economy, visit the EPA’s website.
